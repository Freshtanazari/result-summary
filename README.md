This is my solution to the **[Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV)** challenge.  
The goal was to build a responsive results summary card that displays a total score and individual category scores, matching the given design as closely as possible.
